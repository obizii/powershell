# PowerShell Scripts

**About Me:**

I'm not expert when it comes to PowerShell, but I do find it quite useful to leverage the awesome power to perform every-day repeatable tasks leveraging scripts.  Included in this repository are some of my most used scripts that I hope you find useful as well.

**Quick Notes**

For most, if not all of the PowerShell scripts presented here, please make sure you use them responsibly.  Open each one to review the contents, and don't blindly run them in your environment (especially in production).

One of the methods I tend to use for using these scripts is creating a script repository on the server where I'm running stuff.  Sure, you can call the script directly from Github, but some of them require additional files (like CSV and TXT files).  So, when you are reviewing them, you may see a callout to either a *C:\Scripts* or a *$PSScriptRoot* variable. Be sure to change these variables to suite your preferences.
