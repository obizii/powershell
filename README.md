# PowerShell Scripts

I'm not expert when it comes to PowerShell, but I do find it quite useful to leverage the awesome power to perform every-day repeatable tasks leveraging scripts.  Included in this repository are some of my most used scripts that I hope you find useful as well.

**Create an Active Directory User Object**
> create-ad-user.ps1
> create-ad-user.csv

This script will create an active directory user account, add it to the appropriate OU, and set perameters like password expiration, password string, address, and phone number.
