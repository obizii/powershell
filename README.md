# PowerShell Scripts

## Overview

I've been using PowerShell to help manage hundreds of servers and thousands of user and computer objects within multiple domains. In a Windows domain, it's an essential tool to know and understand.

This repository contains scripts I've used in both my production environments as well as scripts to setup and configure test labs. Please feel free to use anything you see here.

**Quick Notes**

For most, if not all of the PowerShell scripts presented here, please make sure you use them responsibly.  Open each one to review the contents, and don't blindly run them in your environment (especially in production).

## Subfolders

I've tried to break the folder structure down into some core components. Each subfolder listed will have scripts that I've used during my time as a Windows administrator. The core components are broken down into six sections:

- Active Directory (active-directory)
- Cybersecurity (cybersecurity)
- Labs (labs)
- Microsoft 365 (microsoft-365)
- Server Administration (server-admin)
- Workstation Administration (workstation-admin)

### Active Directory (active-directory)

### Cybersecurity (cybersecurity)

### Labs (labs)

### Microsoft 365 (microsoft-365)

### Server Administration (server-admin)

### Workstation Administration (workstation-admin)
